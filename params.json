  "body": "### Welcome to Neat Geo IP\r\nNeat Geo IP is a free and simple GeoIP API based on free version of GeoLite2-City database from [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home). The API helps you to retrieve the country of a provided IP address.\r\n\r\n### Some details\r\nNeat Geo IP is a free GeoIP webservice which allows to retrieve country name of the given IP address. \r\nThe service is based on the free version of GeoLite2-City database from MaxMind. <br> \r\nOur technology stack includes variety of Open source tools/technologies such as [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) framework for development and [Openshift](http://openshift.com/) for hosting the service. <br>\r\nThe service is particularly optimized for Openshift. Since GeoLite2-City database is getting updated monthly, an Openshift specific bash script written to wipe out the current database and restart the service to download the latest database upon starting of the service. Hence, every time service is getting restarted, it automatically downloads the latest fresh database from MaxMind (if does not exist in local storage). Service has monthly down time between 5 to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nFor more details on the project structure, API and how to use it have a look at our <a href=\"documentation.html\">documentation page</a>.\r\n\r\n### License and terms & conditions\r\nThe source code of Neat Geo IP is available under [GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) excluding Maxmind GeoLite2-City  database.
